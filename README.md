This is a port of [cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked) to the [Fabric modloader](https://fabricmc.net/) as well as being a continuation of [JemmaZZ/cc-tweaked-fabric](https://github.com/JemmaZZ/cc-tweaked-fabric) and can be found at [Github Actions](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/cc-restitched/actions), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/cc-restitched) and [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cc-restitched).

CC: R tries to maintain parity with CC: T, though it may be behind or divergent in some areas. If you notice a disparity please open an issue. CC: R major and minor version numbers indicate parity with the major features of that version of CC: T. Patch version numbers will NOT align.

This mod includes textures by [Jummit](https://github.com/Jummit) that are more in line with the style of Mojang's new texture-artist, Jappa. If you prefer the original ComputerCraft textures you should  enable the `classic` resource pack.
 We also have a third resourcepack made by [3prm3](https://github.com/3prm3), it features a complete overhaul of CC's textures (in the style of an industrial mod) and can be used by enabling the `overhaul` resource pack. You can also check out his resource pack over [here](https://github.com/cc-orgs/cc-overhaul/tree/main) as  well!<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-orgs/cc-overhaul/main/pack.png" alt="CC: Restitched" width="32"  height="32"/>

<img src="readme-assets/bleedingedgever.png" alt="CC: Restitched" width="37.5%"/>

Bleeding edge builds can be found [here](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/cc-restitched/actions) at Github Actions.
In the .zip file there should be a `-dev` jar, a `-javadoc` jar, a `-sources-dev` jar, a `-sources` jar, and a "plain" jar (jar without an affixed tag) jar.
Put the "plain" jar in the mods folder.

<img src="readme-assets/contributing.png" alt="CC: Restitched" width="37.5%"/>

Any contribution is welcome, be it using the mod, reporting bugs or contributing code. In order to start helping develop CC: R there are a few rules;
1) Follow the [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) programming guidelines as close as possible. This means you have to use [`loom`](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:mappings) mappings, if you use anything else, your code will be rejected.
2) Make sure your code follows the checkstyle rules. You can test this by running `./gradle build` or `./gradle check`.
3) You cannot intentionally implement bugs and security vulnerabilities.
4) Unless the code is taken directly from CC: Tweaked, `lua` code is offlimits from alteration. If you wish to contribute your changes to the in game rom please contribute upstream at [CC-Tweaked](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked).
5) Branches should be named in this format `mc-<major ver.>.x/<specific-mc-ver.>`

Unfortunately, CC: Restitched does not have as many peripherals mods available as CC: Tweaked though there is one known as Allium Peripherals made by [hugeblank](https://github.com/hugeblank) which can be found [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/allium-peripherals). But if you're an interested mod developer, please check out our `api` package. If you've already made a mod with CC: R peripheral support OR if you're a player who found a mod with CC: R integration, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/cc-restitched/issues/new?assignees=&labels=peripheralShoutout&template=peripheral_shoutout.md) to let us know and we'll add it to the list!
