# What is CC: Restitched?
This is a fabric port of [SquidDev-CC/CC-Tweaked](https://github.com/SquidDev-CC/CC-Tweaked). The work is a continuation of [Zundrel/cc-tweaked-fabric](https://github.com/Zundrel/cc-tweaked-fabric).

## CC: Restitched vs. CC: Tweaked
CC: R tries to maintain parity with CC: T, but may be behind or divergent in some areas. If you notice a disparity please open an issue. CC: R major and minor version numbers indicate parity with the major features of that version of CC: T. Patch version numbers will not align.

## Resource Packs
This mod includes textures by [Jummit](https://github.com/Jummit) that are more in line with the style of Mojang's new texture-artist, Jappa. If you prefer the original textures, enable the "Classic" resource pack.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-orgs/cc-overhaul/main/pack.png" alt="CC: Restitched" width="32"  height="32"/> We also have a second resourcepack made by [3prm3](https://github.com/3prm3), it features a complete overhaul and can be enabled by enabling the `overhaul` resource pack, go check out his resource pack over [here](https://github.com/cc-orgs/cc-overhaul/tree/main)!

## Bleeding Edge Ver.
Bleeding edge builds can be found [here](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/cc-restitched/actions) at Github Actions. In the .zip file there should be a "-dev" jar, a "-javadoc" jar, a "-sources-dev" jar, a "-sources" jar, and a plain (jar without an affixed tag) jar. Put the plain jar in the mods folder.

## Contributions
Any contribution is welcome, be that using the mod, reporting bugs or contributing code. In order to start helping develop CC: R there are a few rules;
1) Follow the [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) programming guidelines as close as possible. This means you have to use [`loom`](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:mappings) mappings, if you use anything else, your code will be rejected.
2) Make sure your code follows the checkstyle rules. You can test this by running `./gradle build` or `./gradle check`.
3)  Do not alter the lua code unless those changes are taken directly from CC: Tweaked. If you wish to contribute changes to the in game rom please contribute upstream at [CC-Tweaked](https://github.com/SquidDev-CC/CC-Tweaked).
4) You cannot intentionally implement bugs and security vulnerabilities.
5) Unless the code is taken directly from CC: Tweaked, `lua` code is offlimits from alteration.
